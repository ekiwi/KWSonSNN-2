    "This is a test Jupyter notebook with implementations of various SNNs for keyword spotting (KWS) on SNNs. The networks developed will end up being implemented in an embedded hardware accelerator targeting low-power computing for e.g. hearing aids or similar. SNNs are ideal for such applications because of their sparse activity, and the application's relatively low requirements in terms of throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses a combination of Numpy, PyTorch, and BindsNET libraries for this task. The dataset considered is a subset of relevant keywords from the speech commands dataset from Google, see [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware accelerator is available in this repository under `./src/main/scala/neuroproc`. The accelerator is written in the Chisel language, which is an open-source HDL within Scala, see [here](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel3). Its design is based on [work by Anthon Riber](https://github.com/Thonner/NeuromorphicProcessor) and is developed as part of a master's thesis at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark."

The overlap of frames serves to limit the risk of missing important information by poor frame \"placement\". Common to all these works is that they use significantly more frames than what is available to this project, if the network in the accelerator is not scaled. Currently, supporting only 22x22 input images limits is performance significantly as this means a significantly larger stride must be used."
